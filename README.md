: Video lectures for newcomers of the Cocoan lab



## Cocoan 101

In the Spring semester of 2021, we made a collective effort to make video lectures (a total of 110 videos [public version has 103 videos], > 28 hours total duration) to provide newcomers to the lab with the basic knowledge about what we are doing in the lab, called Cocoan 101. It covers from the lab philosophy, doing experiments, fMRI preprocessing, advanced fMRI analysis methods and to further study materials and key papers. So many gems here. We decided not to post the playlist link online (in a public place), but we allow sharing the link personally. So if you are interested in watching the Cocoan 101, send a note to any lab members or Wani to share the link. I am so proud of this!!

## Cocoan Study Roadmap
As a part of Cocoan 101, we created a notion page on a study roadmap for the cocoan lab members. It might be helpful for you as well. Please check it out!
